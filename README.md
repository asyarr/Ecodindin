# Ecodindin
This is a python program, it uses tkinter to create a window where people can exchange points, log in and sign up.


You will also need to download others libraries so the program works, the libraries are on top of the code.

This code was made for a college project, the point was creating a programm that could help the environment.
So we made this program where people can gain points when they recicle something and they can change the points 
for products in a supermarket. We used MongoDB to save the informations.
