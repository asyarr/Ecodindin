This is a python program, it uses tkinter library to create a window where peple can log in or sign up.


You will also need to download others libery so the program works, the libraries are on top of the code.

This code was made for a college project, the piot was creating a programm that could help the environment.
So we made this program where people can gain points when they recicle something and they can change the points 
for others products. We used MongoDB to sabe the informations.
