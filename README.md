# Ecodindin

Ecodindin is a Python program developed using the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly interface for point exchange, user login, and sign-up functionalities. The program promotes environmental sustainability by incentivizing recycling activities.

### Features:
- User Interface: Built with Tkinter, the program provides a window where users can log in, sign up, and exchange points.
- Point System: Users earn points by recycling items. These points can be redeemed for products at participating supermarkets.
- Database Integration: MongoDB is used to store user information and track points.

### Requirements:
To ensure the program runs smoothly, several additional libraries are required. The necessary libraries are listed at the top of the code.

### Project Background:
This project was developed as part of a college assignment with the objective of creating a software solution that contributes to environmental conservation. By encouraging recycling through a reward system, Ecodindin aims to motivate individuals to adopt more sustainable practices.
